# Module19Challenge

How many neurons and layers did you select for your neural network model? Why?
 - Used 110 neurons and 1 layer based on input data of 55
 
Were you able to achieve the target model performance? What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
 - Running the model for 50 epochs, was able to achieve the performance requirement of 75%. Was able to achieve this by putting the name, classification and application type columns in to different buckets
 
If you were to implement a different model to solve this classification problem, which would you choose? Why?
  - I would try the deep learning model with different hidden layers to get an better performance.
